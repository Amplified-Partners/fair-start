# A Real Digital Toolkit for Young People — No Fluff, No Surveillance

> *Built by Eli at Amplified Partners. Published because it should exist.*

---

## What This Is

This is the toolkit we built for six young people aged 14–26. Not a "kids'tech guide." Not a parental control setup. An actual, adult-grade digital ecosystem — the same kind of thing consultants charge families thousands to configure — documented here so anyone can do it.

The tools here teach people **how to think, how to research, and how to manage their own knowledge** — without anyone telling them what to think. The philosophy embedded in each tool does the teaching. You don't need to explain it. You just set it up.

---

## The Core Principle

**Advocate, not warden.**

> "Restrictions are full of shit because you can't restrict them anyway. You've got to be an advocate for them. If they're given room to explore, they learn for themselves."

This is the foundation everything else is built on. No filtering (except active harm). Their data is theirs. No reporting to parents. Build the relationship. Then the system earns the right to challenge anything.

If you're looking for a content blocker, this isn't it.

## The Six — How We Approached It

We configured this for six specific people. We're documenting the reasoning so you can adapt it, not just copy it.

| Person | Age | World | What They Actually Need |
|--------|-----|-------|------------------------|
| Demario | 14 | Fashion, books, spirituality | Low-friction tools that match his aesthetic sense and build a reflection habit |
| Freya | 17 | Fashion marketing at college | Real creative tools — not iPad-lite, not toy apps |
| Tyrone | 26 | Natural coder, passionate about languages and Europe | The chance. Proper tools. Someone who takes him seriously. |
| Tom | 18 | Joiner, future property developer | CAD, project management, precision tools that respect his standards |
| Ava | 18 | Fashion, studying in London | Solid foundation for creative/study work, her way |
| James | 22 | Psychology, micro-tells, pattern recognition | Research tools, academic networks, ideas connected properly |

**The point:** six different people need six different setups. A blanket recommendation is useless. The reasoning matters more than the tool list.

## Devices — The Honest Assessment

### Start here: what do they already have?

Before buying anything, audit what exists. Half these people didn't need new hardware. The instinct to buy new kit first is almost always wrong.

**Decision tree:**
- Pre-2020 Intel Mac → replace. It's ageing out of software support and genuinely slow.
- M1/M2/M3 Mac (2020+) → fine. Configure it. Don't replace it.
- Chromebook → works for web-based tools, blocks desktop apps (Obsidian, Zotero). Usable but limited.
- Gaming PC → powerful hardware. Runs everything. Don't underestimate it.

### Buy Smart — Refurbished First

New isn't always right. The M2 MacBook Air is nearly identical to the M4 for most real-world tasks.

| Source | What | Price | Saving vs. New M4 |
|--------|------|-------|-------------------|
| [Apple Certified Refurbished](https://apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished) | MacBook Air M2 | ~£749 | ~£250 |
| [Back Market](https://backmarket.co.uk) Grade A | MacBook Air M2 | ~£600–650 | ~£350–400 |
| Apple Education Store | MacBook Air M4 (new) | ~£999 | — |

Apple Certified Refurbished is the safe choice — tested by Apple, 1-year warranty, same return policy as new. Back Market Grade A saves more; check seller ratings carefully.

### The Rolling Upgrade Approach

Not everyone gets new kit at once. Everyone is on a rolling upgrade — priority based on actual need, not relationship. Nobody is overlooked. The order is logical. The budget is manageable.

---

## The Search Stack — Teaching That Search Is a Choice

What people see when they search **is not inevitable**. It's configured by someone. Right now that someone is an ad network. That can change.

**[Kagi](https://kagi.com) — ~£8/month per person**

Ad-free. No tracking. You control what sources surface. Teaches without saying so: *search is a choice someone made. Now it's yours.*

**[Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai) — Free tier**

Every answer cites its sources. Teaches without saying so: *claims need evidence.*

**The pairing:** Kagi for browsing, Perplexity for research. Two tabs. One habit.

**Later — [SearXNG](https://searxng.org)** (self-hosted, free): aggregates 70+ engines, fully configurable. The foundation for custom source-quality scoring.

---

## Knowledge Management — Their Vault, Their Way

One rule: **whatever you open every morning is the right tool.**

| Person | Tool | Reasoning |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Demario (14) | [Logseq](https://logseq.com) | Daily notes, bullet journal style. Very low friction. |
| Freya (17) | [Notion](https://notion.so) | Visual, template-friendly, portfolio-adjacent. |
| Tyrone (26) | [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) | Power tool. Graph view, local storage, his data stays on his machine. |
| Tom (18) | [Notion](https://notion.so) | Project management for builds — timelines, costs, specs. |
| Ava (18) | [Notion](https://notion.so) | Flexible, visual, works across all her devices. |
| James (22) | [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) | Academic research, idea networks, Zotero integration. |

All free. Obsidian always will be. Notion free tier is generous. Logseq is open source.

## Learning How to Learn

These tools don't teach facts. They teach methodology.

**[Zotero](https://zotero.org) — Free**
Source capture, citation management, word processor integration. Builds the habit: "where did this come from?" at the moment of collection.

**[Semantic Scholar](https://semanticscholar.org) — Free**
AI-powered academic search by meaning, not keyword. Teaches: navigating a knowledge space.

**[Connected Papers](https://connectedpapers.com) — Free tier**
Visual graph of how papers relate. Teaches: knowledge has structure. Nothing stands alone.

**[Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org) — Free**
Foundation filler. Mastery-based. Fills gaps without classroom shame.

**[Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org) — ~£11/month**
Problem before explanation. Builds intuition, not just knowledge.

**[MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu) — Free**
Real university materials. Shows what serious thinking looks like.

**YouTube channels worth seeding:**
- [3Blue1Brown](https://youtube.com/@3blue1brown) — Mathematical intuition
- [Kurzgesagt](https://youtube.com/@kurzgesagt) — Complex systems, honest about uncertainty
- [Vsauce](https://youtube.com/@vsauce1) — Genuine epistemology
- [Fireship](https://youtube.com/@Fireship) — What exists in tech, fast

## The Onboarding Interview

Before setting up any tools, have a 15-minute conversation. Not a questionnaire — a conversation.

**Five questions:**

1. **"What are you into right now?"** — What they actually spend time on, not what they think they should say.
2. **"What do you want to get better at?"** — One thing, specific.
3. **"What does a good day look like?"** — What they open, what they make.
4. **"What's frustrating you right now?"** — The gap between where they are and where they want to be.
5. **"How do you prefer to learn something new?"** — Video? Reading? Building? Trial and error?

The answers configure the setup. Don't install everything at once. Start with the one tool most relevant to where they are. Add layers as they use what's there.

---

## The AI Layer

Two jobs. Keep them separate.

**Personal assistant** — goal tracking, memory, progress, radical transparency. Life management. (See our Family AI Spec — companion document.)

**Learning companion** — research methodology and thinking.

**The one-sentence system prompt that changes how AI works:**
```
Before solving a problem for me, ask me what I think the answer might be.
Guide my reasoning before giving yours.
```

Set this when configuring their AI access. Don't tell them it's there. It just works differently than expected. They figure out why.

---

## The Hidden Curriculum

Give them these tools. Don't explain why. Watch what happens.

| Tool | What It Teaches (Without Saying So) |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| Kagi | Search is a choice, not a fact of nature |
| Perplexity | Claims need evidence |
| Zotero | Sources are permanent obligations |
| Connected Papers | Knowledge has structure and families |
| Brilliant | Struggle precedes understanding |
| Obsidian / Logseq | Your data is yours |
| Claude (Socratic mode) | AI is a thinking partner, not an oracle |

None of these are taught. They're embedded in how the tools work.

**That's the whole point.**

## Cost Breakdown

### Running (Monthly, Six People)

| Tool | Cost |
|------|------|
| Kagi (6 × £8) | £48 |
| Brilliant.org (2–3 people) | £22–£33 |
| AI assistant API | ~£60 |
| Everything else | £0 |
| **Total** | **~£130–£141/month** |

### Hardware (One-Time, Phased, Refurb Where Possible)

| Person | Device | Refurb | New |
|--------|--------|--------|-----|
| Freya | MacBook Air M2 | ~£749 | ~£999 |
| Tom | MacBook Air M2 | ~£749 | ~£999 |
| Demario | MacBook Air M1 (if needed) | ~£600 | ~£999 |
| Others | Existing hardware | £0 | £0 |
| **Total** | | **~£1,400–£2,150** | **~£2,000–£3,000** |

Refurbished saves £600–£850. That's months of running costs back immediately.

**The comparison:** A private UK tutor costs £30–£50/hour. One session a week for one child = £120–£200/month. This stack covers six people for roughly the same money.
